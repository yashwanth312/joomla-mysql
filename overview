The JOOMLA is a 100% and free open source content management system for publishing web content.


JOOMLA is written in the PHP language and uses object-oriented programming techniques and software design patterns. In this process I've used the MYSQL version 5.6 as the database.




For installing the JOOMLA from this repository you should ne knowing:


1. DATABASE HOST NAME = mydb
2. DATABASE PASSWORD = yash
